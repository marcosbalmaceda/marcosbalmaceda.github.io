      <p>Generative AI could help vulnerable entrepreneurs overcome information disadvantages, yet adoption remains minimal. Among Chilean microentrepreneurs—most without higher education or formal business training—AI tools remain largely unused despite their potential to democratize access to business expertise. We test whether beliefs about AI benefits explain this adoption gap through a randomized controlled trial. We randomize entrepreneurs into receiving information on the potential of GenAI as a business consultant or as a content creator, with a control group receiving neutral technical information. Through incentivized willingness-to-pay elicitation, we measure how information affects beliefs about GenAI's business value. We evaluate the impact of exogenously changing beliefs on GenAI take-up and on firm performance. Results inform whether low-cost information interventions can help reduce inequality in entrepreneurial success.</p>

      <p>This study examines how mandatory disclosure policies affect entrepreneurial resource acquisition when traditional credibility signals vary. We propose a conditional substitution framework where platform certification replaces missing reputational signals. Exploiting Kickstarter’s mandatory AI use disclosure policy as a quasi-natural experiment across 27,845 projects, we find that mandatory disclosure significantly enhances funding outcomes for AI-using entrepreneurs overall, though effects vary substantially by entrepreneur type. First-time entrepreneurs lacking track records experience positive effects, while serial entrepreneurs with established reputations experience negative effects. While prior work demonstrates that signals typically complement one another, we provide empirical evidence that platform verification’s value depends critically on entrepreneurs’ existing signal portfolios. These findings identify boundary conditions to signal complementarity and reveal how governance design democratizes market access.</p>

      <p>Technology licensing creates a paradox for knowledge-based firms: monetizing intellectual property through outlicensing simultaneously exposes tacit knowledge holders—the inventors—to the licensee. Drawing on the knowledge-based view and signaling theory, we argue that licensing agreements signal inventor quality and, through clauses facilitating knowledge exchange, create organizational proximity that enables inventor poaching. Using machine learning to classify 340,000 clauses across 3,558 pharmaceutical licensing agreements, we find that outlicensing increases inventor mobility by 26–30 percentage points, with the dominant flow directed toward the licensee rather than the broader market. Crucially, contractual design moderates this effect heterogeneously: neither knowledge transfer provisions nor joint governance structures alone reduce within-dyad mobility, but their combination in relational contracts—where tacit knowledge exchange is embedded within shared decision-making structures—reduces mobility by 12–19 percentage points. This complementarity reveals that contractual mechanisms mitigating brain drain must simultaneously facilitate and govern knowledge transfer.</p>

    <p>Despite evidence that skills-based entrepreneurship training improves outcomes, scalability remains limited by reliance on expert facilitators. We test whether AI tutors employing self-regulated learning (SRL) pedagogical principles can replicate the benefits of expert coaching while fostering durable learning capabilities. In collaboration with France Travail (the French national employment agency), we conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial with 460,000 eligible unemployed job seekers. Participants are assigned to online entrepreneurship courses (Personal Initiative or Negotiation Skills) delivered through three modalities: standard content only, content with a basic AI assistant, or content with an SRL-based AI coach. The SRL-based coach employs metacognitive scaffolding—prompting learners to articulate assumptions, test their reasoning, and reflect on their learning process—without providing direct answers. Through repeated metacognitive practice, learners internalize effective learning strategies that persist beyond the intervention. We hypothesize that SRL-based coaching will be most effective for participants with lower baseline self-regulatory capacity. Outcomes span from proximal measures (course completion, knowledge retention of entrepreneurial content) and learning process skills to long-term economic outcomes (venture creation, employment, income) measured 12-18 months post-intervention.</p>

    <p>We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AI coaching versus human mentorship for delivering entrepreneurial soft skills at scale in resource-constrained contexts. In a randomized controlled trial with 120,000 secondary students across Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, we compare digital Personal Initiative courses alone to courses augmented with either AI coaching or trained human mentors. Our AI implementation uses a dual large language model architecture where a second LLM judges each response to reduce hallucinations and ensure pedagogical alignment. We measure impacts on Personal Initiative, metacognitive skills, and post-graduation employment and entrepreneurial outcomes. The multi-country design enables us to assess heterogeneous treatment effects across diverse institutional contexts and estimate cost-effectiveness of alternative delivery models for human capital development in developing economies.</p>

      <p>Technology adoption among resource-constrained entrepreneurs remains low despite potential productivity gains. Traditional in-person training can improve outcomes but faces severe scalability constraints, while existing online courses show poor completion rates and limited effectiveness. We examine whether a cost-effective MOOC intervention integrating business practices with technological skills can achieve meaningful adoption and performance improvements at scale. In collaboration with ChileConverge, we conduct a randomized controlled trial with Chilean micro-entrepreneurs (N≈1,000) comparing a MOOC that teaches four core business practices—marketing, inventory management, record-keeping, and financial planning—with embedded instruction on using generative AI to implement these practices, against a pure control group. This integrated approach teaches business frameworks and technological tools as complementary capabilities rather than sequentially. We measure AI adoption (extensive and intensive margins), business practice implementation, and firm performance (revenue and profits) at baseline and 2-month follow-up. We test for heterogeneous treatment effects by gender, prior entrepreneurial experience, and baseline digital literacy. Our study addresses whether scalable online interventions can overcome both the quality limitations of traditional MOOCs and the cost barriers of in-person training, contributing to theories of technology adoption and training design in resource-constrained entrepreneurial contexts.</p>

    <p>This  article  examines  the  economic  cost  of  crime  in  Chile  in  the  past  decade.  Following  the  literature,  we  categorize  the  economic losses due to criminal activities into (a) anticipation costs, (b) consequence  costs,  and  (c)  response  costs,  and  apply  an  accounting  method  to  quantify  the  direct  losses  due  to  crime.  We  consider  various  types  of  crime-related  costs  such  as  expenses  in  security,  insurance  and  medical  treatments  of  victims,  loss  of  labor  income  by  victims  and  inmates,  and  the  economic  cost  of  deaths  due  to  crime,  among  others.  By  relying  on  data  from  multiple  sources  such  as  tax  records,  government  budgets,  and  official  crime  reports,  we  report  a  lower  bound for the economic costs of crime in Chile of 2.1% of GDP in 2022, 46%  higher  than  the  cost  (in  percent  of  GDP)  estimated  for  2013  (90%  higher  if  measured  in  USD  of  equal  purchasing  power).  We  find  that  in  recent  years  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  anticipation  costs,  mainly  driven  by  the  rise  in  security  spending  by  the  private  sector.  Results  also  show  a  significant  growth  in  costs  due  to  homicide  and  vehicle  theft  cases  in  recent  years  —  the  latter  is  also  a  cost  borne  by  the  private  sector.  The  paper  shows  that  the  cost  of  crime  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  has  increased  steadily  over  the  past  decade,  highlighting  the  need  for  a  reassessment  of  security  policies  focusing  on  more  effective  prevention  and  response  strategies.  This  research  contributes  to  understanding  the  economic  impact  of  crime  in  Chile  and  calls  for  policies  addressing  the  evolving  challenges  posed  by  criminal activities.</p>
