    <p>We examine how information provision affects entrepreneurs' beliefs and technology adoption decisions through a randomized controlled trial with Chilean micro-entrepreneurs (N≈1,000). Participants received randomized information treatments about generative AI benefits: quantitative evidence (15% profit increase), qualitative examples of AI as business advisor, creative collaborator, or placebo information. Using incentive-compatible willingness-to-pay measures and instrumental variables design, we find information treatments significantly update beliefs about AI value and increase adoption intentions. Effects persist at 2-month follow-up, with heterogeneous responses by gender and prior technology experience. Results demonstrate that strategic information provision can overcome adoption barriers for productivity-enhancing technologies among resource-constrained entrepreneurs, offering implications for technology diffusion and entrepreneurial capability development in emerging markets.</p>

    <p>The rapid adoption of AI has raised transparency concerns. Digital platforms have increasingly responded by mandating disclosure of AI use. Drawing on disclosure and certification theories, we suggest mandatory AI disclosure functions as a pseudo-certification mechanism, reducing information asymmetry and enhancing credibility. Analyzing 28,428 Kickstarter projects, we use conditional difference-in-differences focused on the period surrounding the platform's 2023 mandatory AI disclosure policy. Our analyses provide causal evidence that mandatory disclosure increases funding success probability by 13 percentage points for AI-disclosing projects. We explore moderating effects of project type and creator demographics. Our findings shed light on how platform governance shapes resource acquisition through verified transparency mechanisms.</p>

    <p>We examine an overlooked strategic challenge in biopharmaceutical technology licensing: how outlicensing affects inventor retention. Using 3,558 pharmaceutical licensing agreements (2000-2015) matched with patent data, we find inventors whose technologies are outlicensed exhibit 50% higher mobility rates than matched controls. This "brain drain" represents a hidden cost of licensing strategies in knowledge-intensive industries. We investigate whether relational contract design—characterized by collaborative provisions fostering ongoing partnership—can mitigate this effect. Using machine learning to classify contracts and staggered difference-in-differences estimation, we reveal how strategic IP decisions influence human capital outcomes. Our findings contribute to understanding how technology strategy and contract design shape innovation capabilities in the biopharmaceutical sector, where both knowledge transfer and talent retention are critical for competitive advantage.</p>

    <p>This study investigates whether AI-enhanced metacognitive practice during entrepreneurial training creates durable improvements in entrepreneurial decision-making among unemployed job-seekers in France. We conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing standard entrepreneurial training (Personal Initiative and Negotiation Skills) with AI-augmented versions featuring retrieval-augmented generation chatbots designed as metacognitive coaches. Rather than providing information, these AI tutors guide learners through systematic hypothesis testing, assumption identification, and structured reflection using self-regulated learning frameworks. Our theoretical framework proposes that AI's value lies in intensifying metacognitive practice through personalized dialogue, consistent modeling, and active strategy generation. We expect stronger effects for participants with lower initial metacognitive abilities who acquire transferable problem-solving frameworks, moderated by prior AI familiarity and attitudes. We hypothesize that AI-enhanced training will improve both proximal metacognitive capabilities and distal venture performance outcomes, with effects persisting beyond technological support removal.</p>

    <p>We investigate whether integrated training combining business practices with generative AI skills enhances entrepreneurial performance and decision-making quality. Using a randomized controlled trial with Chilean micro-entrepreneurs (N≈1,000), we compare an intervention teaching core business practices (marketing, financial management, operations) alongside strategic AI prompting techniques against an active control group. Our design incorporates novel measures of economic rationality through Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP) tests to assess decision-making quality improvements. Results show the combined intervention significantly increases business practice adoption, AI utilization, and objective performance metrics (sales, profits). Importantly, we find evidence that training enhances economic rationality, suggesting improved decision-making processes mediate performance gains. Effects exhibit heterogeneity by gender and entrepreneurial experience. These findings demonstrate that strategic capability-building interventions can simultaneously enhance both technological adoption and fundamental decision-making quality among resource-constrained entrepreneurs.</p>

    <p>This  article  examines  the  economic  cost  of  crime  in  Chile  in  the  past  decade.  Following  the  literature,  we  categorize  the  economic losses due to criminal activities into (a) anticipation costs, (b) consequence  costs,  and  (c)  response  costs,  and  apply  an  accounting  method  to  quantify  the  direct  losses  due  to  crime.  We  consider  various  types  of  crime-related  costs  such  as  expenses  in  security,  insurance  and  medical  treatments  of  victims,  loss  of  labor  income  by  victims  and  inmates,  and  the  economic  cost  of  deaths  due  to  crime,  among  others.  By  relying  on  data  from  multiple  sources  such  as  tax  records,  government  budgets,  and  official  crime  reports,  we  report  a  lower  bound for the economic costs of crime in Chile of 2.1% of GDP in 2022, 46%  higher  than  the  cost  (in  percent  of  GDP)  estimated  for  2013  (90%  higher  if  measured  in  USD  of  equal  purchasing  power).  We  find  that  in  recent  years  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  anticipation  costs,  mainly  driven  by  the  rise  in  security  spending  by  the  private  sector.  Results  also  show  a  significant  growth  in  costs  due  to  homicide  and  vehicle  theft  cases  in  recent  years  —  the  latter  is  also  a  cost  borne  by  the  private  sector.  The  paper  shows  that  the  cost  of  crime  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  has  increased  steadily  over  the  past  decade,  highlighting  the  need  for  a  reassessment  of  security  policies  focusing  on  more  effective  prevention  and  response  strategies.  This  research  contributes  to  understanding  the  economic  impact  of  crime  in  Chile  and  calls  for  policies  addressing  the  evolving  challenges  posed  by  criminal activities.</p>
